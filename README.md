# This Project uses ReactJs[create-react-app] using a JSON-Server serving as fake REST API

This project uses the backend JSON file [db.json] [(https://my-json-server.typicode.com/ultraammar/reactjs-blog-crud-json-server/articles)].

## Features

In the project, you have a simple blog where you can create new articles, and view/delete existing ones.

## Limitations

As this uses typicode for hosting the fake REST API, it cannot change the backend dynamically, so the changes do not persist. But the change can persist if we deploy it on local environment.
